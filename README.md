Chagu
=====

Chagu (pronounced chÃ¢ghu, or knife) is a Python module designed to ease
visualisation of vector fields. It is designed to render magnetic moment vector
fields from the discipline of micromagnetics, but can be extended to any
project requiring vector field plots. It uses VTK to do this. Here is a pretty
example:

"Python eh? I bet it's really slow!"
====================================

As of 23/04/2016, the test suite creates 25 visualisations, and performs 204
(somewhat basic) render operations all in 6.37 seconds on my 2012 Dell, without
compiled Python files. Not subtracting the time for other testing tasks,

thats at most 0.03 seconds per render operation.

That's pretty fast (though you should thank VTK for that).

Requirements
============

To use Chagu like we do, you will need:

 - Python 2.7.10
 - VTK 5.10.1 (support for >6 is coming, possibly)
 - Numpy 1.9.2
 - Matplotlib 1.3.1
 - GraphViz (the python module) 0.4.5

Getting Started and Helping Out
===============================

To get some idea of how to use this module, add the path of this repository to
your PYTHONPATH. Some examples are in "example/examples.py", which demonstrate
the functionality of this module.

If you want to help out, the "notes/chagu.org" orgfile contains some tasks to
do. Try opening it with emacs.

A Word on Offscreen Rendering
=============================

Some systems seem to have trouble rendering offscreen with VTK. This is
important when trying to save a batch of images. One solution to this problem
is to render using a virtual framebuffer, which can be done using Xvfb, Xpra,
or similar. As an example in your terminal:

```
$ xpra start :25
$ export TEMP_DISPLAY=$DISPLAY
$ export DISPLAY=:25
$ python example.py
$ export DISPLAY=$TEMP_DISPLAY
$ xpra stop :25
```
