Chagu
=====

Chagu (pronounced chÃ¢ghu, or knife) is a Python module designed to ease
visualisation of vector fields. It is designed to render magnetic moment vector
fields from the discipline of micromagnetics, but can be extended to any
project requiring vector field plots. It uses VTK to do this.

Requirements
============

To use Chagu, you will need:

 - Python 2.7
 - VTK 5.8.0 (support for >6 is coming, possibly)
 - Numpy
 - GraphViz (the python module)

Getting Started and Helping Out
===============================

To get some idea of how to use this module, add the path of this repository to
your PYTHONPATH. Some examples are in "example/examples.py", which demonstrate
the functionality of this module.

If you want to help out, the "notes/chagu.org" orgfile contains some tasks to
do. Try opening it with emacs.
