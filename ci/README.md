This directory is where scripts and environments for continuous integration
(CI) builds on CircleCI live. Builds are done using MiniConda
(http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). A Conda environment is created using
the Conda package list in requirements_conda.txt, and the Python package list
in requirements_pip.txt.

These files may be a convenient (and potentially cross-platform) way to get
Chagu working on your machine.
