# So we have a decent level of working functionality in Chagu. It is possible
# to produce some output visualisations using short, simple scripts. In
# retrospect, driving the development of this software using tests would have
# been ideal because it means that the interface is designed for the user, as
# opposed to match the functionality of Chagu. Unfortunatly, this is not what I
# did when starting this project. Future features will warrant the use of
# test-driven development to save time, reduce code complexity, and make me
# happier. This will not retroactively fix existing features. To make up for
# this, I am developing some tests to back-test this project. These black box
# tests will exist from the user-interface level to the level of internals. The
# rest of this note describes some testing objectives.
#
# I run tests with:
#
#   py.test --cov=chagu test/ --cov-report term-missing --cov-report annotate --verbose
#
# Using the plugin pytest-cov installable from pip.

* TODO Refactor code for testability
  We have a God object problem. Divide visualisation methods into functions
  that create the object, and apply that object to the visualisation
  object. This change will make code easier to test, so consider making this
  change before implementing more tests.
* IN-PROGRESS Write test descriptions for other files
** TODO filters.py
** TODO mask.py
** TODO pipeline.py
** TODO termini.py
* TODO sources.py functionality (load_visualisation_toolkit_file)

   vis.get_vtk_object(name) returns a vtkReader object with the filename set
   appropriately.
   vis._boundingBox is set appropriately

   Bounding box is a box that encloses all data.
